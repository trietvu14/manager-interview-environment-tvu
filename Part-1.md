# Triet Vu - Part 1 Responses

## 1. Based on what you’ve read, describe three strengths which the team has and three opportunities the team has for improvement.

STRENGTHS:

1. High Technical Competence & Well Structured Software Development Life Cycle  - "The team maintains a well-organized codebase with extensive automated tests and smooth CI/CD pipelines." This indicates a well thought out SDLC, including well defined DevOps practices, including Dinesh's proactive monitoring of logs helps with identifying bugs in the application.

2. Strong Individual Skill Sets with Good Work Ethics - "The outgoing manager said, this team 'knows their stuff and shows up.'" This is indicated with Dinesh proactively monitoring logs, Case leaving detailed comments, and Elise/Farah motivated by the mission of Tech-Assist. Team members are busy and don't appear to demonstrate any obvious slacking off.

3. Mission Alignment & Team Cohesion - Team members show up, are motivated by Tech-Assist's mission, and demonstrate commitment. This is not only characterized by the outgoing manager's assessment but also in the team's comfort level in implementation discussions.

OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT

1. Cross-Functional Collaboration & Product Strategy - The team is passive rather than proactive in helping to define requirements as a part of the discovery process. Each team member brings an expertise and/or perspective that can potentially be invaluable to the success of Tech-Assist, including a unique approach to solving problems. Alex's dominance in cross-functional meetings and dismissive attitude towards product perspectives creates an unhealthy dynamic that undermines the product team. Product strategy should define the technology solution and not the other way around. 

2. Effective Work Planning & Low Predictability - A consistent sprint carryover despite no obvious slacking indicates issues with capacity planning, undefined priorities, or potential unforseen blockers. Farah's tickets for 3 sprints seem to indicate a poor support structure for junior engineers.

3. Over-reliance on Alex & Ownership - Alex's dominance of the entire product improvement and technical development process is problematic when it stifles collaboration and places too much of the decision-making on one person. In this scenario, Alex is reshaping product improvements developed by Yuehan and the product design team to fit her technology biases. On the technology team side, this creates a bottleneck as all decisions are run through Alex without providing a level of autonomy and ownership to team members for the work they do. This tends to lead to recurring bugs and work that gets carried over from sprint to sprint.


## 2. What further information would you need to learn in order to lead the team and how would you go about gathering it?

I would need to have a good understanding of both product and business strategies and not just the strategy or goal for the matching feature. I would set up a meeting with Yuehan to understand the current Tech-Assist Portal product and what product improvements have been concepted. I'd also need to know what concerns Yuehan is having with engineering, regarding quality, reliability, or any collaboration concerns he might have. I'd also want to know what market research has been done, what user interviews or focus groups have been conducted, what the findings are, what metrics have been set up and what those results are showing. If possible, I'd like to sit in on a few of those interviews or focus groups. I'd like to also define what 10% growth target means. Does that mean projects posted or projects completed? Does that mean 10% user base growth? I'd need to know what the current baseline is for all of metrics and what our timeline looks like to meet that target goal. If possible, I'd like to meet with the funders to clarify and confirm goals, timelines and success metrics.

From a technical standpoint, I'd need to first understand the current team and cross-team dynamics. I'd start with observing sprint ceremonies and cross-functional meetings myself. I would conduct an extensive review of the last two quarters of sprints, including current in-progress sprints, tickets, and errors. I'd conduct meetings with all members of the engineering team to get an understanding of team velocity, workload and blockers. I'd also need to understand the current team culture, how they interact with one another, and how they collaborate with one another to solve problems. This will help me to define internal and cross-team processes and determine where operational and communication issues exists.


## 3. What open questions, risks, and assumptions do you have about the Product Improvement Vision and the organization’s goals?

Product questions: "What user or market research has been done to support the new features?", "What's the data for the current features of Tech-Assist Portal look like for current users as well as for users that have dropped off early?", "Have those users that have dropped off been surveyed?", "If so, what are their concerns or pain points?", and "What are the organizational goals for the Tech-Assist Portal?"

Regarding technical questions, I'd need to know answers to questions like, "Does the Tech-Assist Port need to integrate with other platforms or systems?", "What do we want to learn from the data?", "What data points or metrics are captured?", "How are we analyzing and visualizing this data?", "Does our current architecture support a proposed feature like the matching feature, such as heuristics, ML or Agentic AI?", "What do we mean by 'outbound communications'?", "Does this include email, SMS, Push notifications?", "How well does our architecture and infrastructure scale?", and "How easily can our current architecture add new functionality and grow?"

Risks: Product related risk of current product not being supported by metrics and market research. The engineering team is at risk of burnout. Cross-functional team dynamics could put the initiative at risk if Tech-Assist is built on technical decisions rather market research.

Assumptions: The matching feature is an effective feature for increasing usage and adoption. The passive approach that volunteers use to search out projects and poor communication is the problem and not the bugs/errors and reliability of Tech Assist. Volunteers are comfortable receiving increased communications rather than being annoyed by them. There's funding to support the cost of this new feature. The timeline is reasonably set to allow for the 10% growth. And finally, the engineering team has the capacity to add this feature.


## 4. Given the state of the team and the organization’s strategic goal, how would you prioritize your team’s areas for improvement that you identified in Question 1? How might you make progress in the most important area?

I'd start by clearly defining all roles and ownership of the work while resetting the dynamic between Alex and Yuehan. This relationship should be a partnership with a clear distinction between product and engineering. I'd emphasize that both are highly valued and bring an expertise to the table that is critical to the success of the Tech-Assist Portal. I would facilitate a conversation between the two and help establish a norm for how both leaders and teams would interact with clear guidelines. 

Next, I would work with both Alex and Yuehan to develop a discovery process that would include a structured agenda with a short problem statement, user and market data, defined success metrics, assumptions and a series of open questions. It's important and useful to put the facts on the table to have a common starting point. Yuehan and the product team should lead the discussion, but it should include input from all team members. I would encourage Alex to wait until everyone has contributed before adding her input. 

I would broaden cross-functional team participation by assigning Case and Ben to review data analysis, observe user interview sessions for new features, such as the matching feature, and provide a technology perspective to feature discussions. This takes responsibilities away from Alex to ensure she has more time, but also provides Ben with opportunities to consider the project from a more strategic perspective while giving Case an opportunity to understand the business side of Tech-Assist. Both will provide briefing to the engineering team during Agile ceremonies which will provide context and/or validation to the direction that engineering should take.

Weekly alignment meetings between product and engineering should established. I would rotate engineering team members through those meetings.This will provide all engineering team members with a larger understanding of the work, but also helps to improve cross-team relations.

A decision log should be established to ensure that all team members have an understanding of what has been decided in order to avoid a continuous debate. A risk log should also be established to call out any issues that are identified and how they are prioritized. 

This is how I would prioritize my team's areas for improvement. I believe that a cohesive team makes for a more efficient and productive team. This begins with setting a culture of collaboration where everyone's voice is valued with no ego.
